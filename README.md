My very first React App 

I learned alot through this project, this took me awhile to make as it was my first ever attempt at making anything in React.
Google became my best friend during this proccess, searching through multiple web pages and referencing various tutorial videos.
React is not easy but i learned to love it and can see myself using this framework alot in the future.
